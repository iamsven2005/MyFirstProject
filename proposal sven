red: sports, attention, passion
blue: trust peace intelligence, security.
yellow:fun and bold color, energy, entertainment
green: safety, health nature, medical, 
orange: joy and confidence, energy and communication, use with blue
purple: luxury, power, smooth.
analogous: another content
monochrome: hero
complementary: white spaces
readability, reduced font types(2-3),  typefaces,roles, and attributes.
the smaller the ratio, the less the contrast. 3/4
spacing: padding, margin,distance, 8-point sys(values multiple of 8) for consistency and communication.(8px) 12 col grid(figma)
visual heirachy is imortant, zig zag, sysmetric, white space,match icons. Icons should be meaningful and consistent.pair with text.keep it real, use real photos.
patterns is a solution to a common problem, alert bar(ad+ greet), header(nav+ search+ action+logo) have big search in shop/search main func, hero(quick showcase) carousell/action + images/videos,
buttons: a fundamental element that serves as a middleman between user and service. Use different style but similar overall layout.Try to add icon, padding on top and bottom is half left right.
 Make it visable and clickable. Make it interactive(on hover, on click)-> tip: go to codepen to search for buttons. 
Image slideshows:An  image gallery is a way of displaying a collection of images while allowing users to see several images at once. For product/service use.
Use of inbetween: use content that spaces out content, (animation, quotes, etc) so as to not have continuous text. tip->Checkout parallax effect.
Footer: area positioned at the bottom of every page on the website, below content. Policy stuff, settings, db render stuff, site maps, things not for main content.
Testimonials: establish credibility, add pictures of them for context
Add guards to sections with viewability. Use box shadows to highlights
Tab:a tab control is a ui element where content is separated intodifferent panels with only one panel visible at a time the hidden panels can then be accessed through user interaction tabs used for displaying large amounts of content in a relatively small area.. Highlight the opened tab with 1 style change.
Accordions.unlike tabs accordions can display multiple panels at once and they're used for simpler content like text. (FAQ, tutorials, qn based)
Contact form: Usually connected to db. keep your contact form simple so that your potential clients can easily get in touch as a minimum a contact form should require a name an email address and the msg.
Responsive design: use media queries and relative sizes, keep responsiveness in mind,  send file to your phone for testing. Hence gird layout is often used.
Prototyping: a link between screens and demonstrates how the website will function. Link prototype in figma for ui/ux diff, so others can see before dev starts.
Look up designs like minimalist, bold, tech, neumorphism, zen...
To make it nice, do in figma first. Reference from sites below+ similar function sites.

tint:add white,hue: add black,primary, secondary, tritiary, 

reasons not to use bootstrap,(personal reason). It is not clean, it is hard to customise, the code is too intensive, kinda overated ngl.
reasons to use svg, no loss, customisable, less, data(faster),allows for animation, easily convertible, cannot be stolen(source is hard to connvert), large inspo from !cp.
