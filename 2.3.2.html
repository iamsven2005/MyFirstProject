        <ul>
            <li>Studies have shown that physical activity can improve mental health and well-being.This improvement is due to an increase in blood flow to the brain, allowing for the release of hormones as well as a decrease stress hormones in the body (e.g., cortisol, adrenaline) while also stimulating the human body's mood boosters and natural painkillers.[48] Not only does exercise release these feel-good hormones, it can also help relieve stress and help build confidence.[49] These trends improve as physical activity is performed on a consistent basis, which makes exercise effective in relieving symptoms of depression and anxiety, positively impacting mental health and bringing about several other benefits. </li>
