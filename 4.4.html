  <h3>What is Calisthenics?</h3>
  <br>
  <p>Well, simply put calisthenics is a form of exercise that consists of a variety of movements
    <br>
    that are often performed with little to no equipment.
    <br>
    It involves the use of your own bodyweight in order to carry out various kinds of exercises.
    <br>
    These exercises make full use of your motor skills, with movement types such as pulling,
    <br>
    bending, pushing or swinging the body in different kinds of ways to achieve certain body forms.
    </p>
  <h3>Many Different of Exercises</h3>
  <p>Thinking of it in this way, so many kinds of exercise can be described as
    <br>
    calisthenics. Pull-ups, push-ups, lunges, squats, dips and the planche are typical
    <br>
    Icalisthenics exercises. Within a proper calisthenics workout, they come in
    <br>
    different variations, each designed to exercise different muscle groups of the body.
    <br>
    In essence, calisthenics is a form of exercise that makes full use of your weight to
    <br>
    help you work out different parts of the body.
    <br>
    </p>
    <h3>The 4 Greatest Benefits of Calisthenics</h3>
    <p>So what do people gain from a proper calisthenics training routine? There are a
      <br>
      number of reasons why calisthenics is a preferable way to work out for many people.
      </p>
      <li>
        <h3>1. Increased Body Strength and Endurance</h3>
      <p>Every time you train, you are using the weight of your body to work out certain
        <br>
        specific muscle groups. This makes the muscle groups stronger, and better able
        <br>
        to support your body weight in return. Think of it as resistance training, which
        <br>
        increases average energy expenditure.
        <br>
        The stronger your muscles get, the longer you can be able to hold certain
        <br>
        positions and the more reps or sets of an exercise you can be able to do. It builds
        <br>
        your overall endurance, allowing you to go the extra mile in your calisthenics training every time.
        <br>
        </p></li>
        <li>
          <h3>2. Improved Biomechanics of the Body</h3>
          <p>
        Calisthenics teaches the body to be more balanced and better coordinated.
        <br>
        Even your posture improves in the process. It is a form of gymnastics that
        <br>
        needs you to balance to support various postures. Countless studies link this
        <br>
        form of exercise to better motor coordination and body balance.
        </p></<li>
          <li><h3>3. Improved Mental Health</h3>
          <p>
        The best thing about calisthenics is the fact that it doesn’t benefit your body
        <br>
        alone. Your mind stands to gain something from it as well. Once you become
        <br>
        aware of what your body can do, it can be an enlightening and confidence-
        <br>
        boosting feeling. This form of exercise has also been linked to reduced depressive
        <br>
        symptoms, meaning that it can uplift your mood drastically. This is because a
        <br>
        good calisthenics workout allows the body to release endorphins, and they
        <br>
        effectively combat the effects of stress.
        </p></<li>
          <li><h3>4. Improved Economics</h3>
          <p>
        You really don’t need any expensive machinery to get the most out of your
        <br>
        calisthenics exercises. All you need is your body and a place for you to exercise it.
        <br>
        That is all. It is a very affordable way to get your body fit without breaking the
        <br>
        bank. Therefore, we do not sell high expensive Calisthenics equipment but only items that are really useful.
        <br>
        </p></<li>
          <h3>How do You Get Into Calisthenics?</h3>
          <p><br>
          Knowing everything that you do about calisthenics, it is understandable that you
          <br>
          would want to know where to start. Getting into calisthenics is actually very easy.

          <br>
          carried out over a short period of time. Exercises like squats, planks, pushups,
          <br>
          lunges, mountain climbers, leg raises, crunches and sit ups are great beginner’s
          <br>
          exercises. Have about 3 to 4 cycles of 8 to 10 reps of about 5 or 6 different kinds of
          <br>
          exercises before resting. As you continue to exercise, you can increase the
          <br>
          intensity of each exercise and incorporate even more complex exercises in your routine.

    <br>With your arms straight, your shoulders should be over your wrists and your hips should be over your knees
    <br>(a). Bend your elbows and lower your upper body slowly to the ground
    <br>(b). When your nose reaches the floor, press up with your arms and return to the starting position

  <h2>Clap push-up</h2>
  <p>
    <br>Start in a standard push up position. Get into an arm-supported position with your hands positioned beneath your shoulders and fingers spread slightly, ready to push.
    <br>Engage the muscles of the core and lower back by tensing the abdominals to keep your body in one rigid line. Poise on the toes or balls of your feet to maintain balance throughout the movement.
    <br>In push up position, the body should be firmly locked into place, but not tense. It can help to keep the neck straight and the legs in line under the hips as if you were standing.
  <img src = "page4stuff\Tuts\tut6.jpg" alt = "push up 4" height= auto width=auto>
  <hr>
  <br>Lower yourself until your chest is just above the floor.
  <br>Bend the elbows to initiate the first part of the push up.
  <br>Keep the elbows close the body and lower your weight in a smooth, controlled manner.
  <br>The lowering portion of the push up should take between half a second to a full second; any longer will be using up strength and stability.
  <br>Stop lowering yourself when your chest touches the floor, or just above it.
  <br><img src = "page4stuff\Tuts\tut7.jpg" alt = "push up 4" height= auto width=auto>
  <hr>
  <br>Push! Reverse the motion by pushing hard through the palms.
  <br>Again, focus on speed here. Imagine that you’re attempting to push yourself all the way up to a standing position.
  <br>Keep your force consistent through every part of the push up.
  <br><img src = "page4stuff\Tuts\tut8.jpg" alt = "push up 4" height= auto width=auto>
  <hr>
  <br>Let your hands leave the floor. Just as your arms reach full extension, pull your hands up off the floor.
  <br>Timing of this part of the movement is crucial: if you time it right, you should feel like you’re floating for a brief moment.
  <br>This is the interval during which you will perform the clap. If you find that you’re having trouble with your timing, continue feeling out the final part of the movement using the plyo push up.
  <br>If you lift the hands too soon or too late, you’ll lose the benefit of momentum and all height.
  <br><img src = "page4stuff\Tuts\tut9.jpg" alt = "push up 4" height= auto width=auto>
  <hr>
  <br>Quickly clap and reposition your hands. Once you’ve pushed your body up and your hands are off the floor, bring them together in one quick motion in front of the chest.
  <br>Ideally, you should clap the hands together while hovering in the highest position of the "jump," and be ready to plant them back down by the time you begin descending.
  <br>Separate the hands and place them back underneath your shoulders, catching yourself as you fall.[3]
  <br>It’s okay to catch yourself somewhat low as you descend. This might make it tricky to begin the next clapping push up if you’re performing them in sequence, but it’s safer to land on bent, expectant arms.
  <br>Landing in full extension may jar the elbows.

<button class="accordion">How to do pull-ups</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p><img src = "page4stuff\Tuts\tut11.webp" alt = "push up 4" height= auto width=auto>
    Leap up and grip the bar with your hands shoulder width apart and your palms facing away from you. Hang with your arms fully extended, you can bend your legs at the knee if they’re dragging on the ground.
Keep your shoulders back and your core engaged throughout. Then pull up. Focus on enlisting every upper body muscle to aid your upward endeavours.
Move slowly upward until your chin is above the bar, then equally slowly downward until your arms are extended again.
Aim for 10 pull-ups, but be prepared to fall short.

<br> Or... find a assisted pull up machine and start from there.
