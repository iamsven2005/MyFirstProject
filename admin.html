            I have pior content before coming to this school with a wix website with over 125 rated fitness corners, a youtube chanel for said website, a insta page, linked in page and twitter account. All the content in this page is hand written and codepen inspired projects are rewritten by hand. All videos are done with the help of canva.<br>
            Orange is the color of vibrancy and activeness, it inherits the traits of red without any of the draw backs. Used together with black, it creates a spirit of energy and being down to earth, exactly in line with our moto. I decided to use svg logos for navigation due to it being a universal language, loads faster and does not affect in resizing. <br>
            Open white words are optimised with san serif to enhance loading speed across all platforms, allowing better readability and typography while going hand in hand with the white-space of orange. In a boxing match in a ring, when the competitor is taking a break, a cornerman will support the competitor to get ready for the next round. Just like a cornerman, cornerguys is like the backbone of fitness.<br>
            As such our logo is made like a 3d mini pull up-bar with a 70% circle surrounding it, the circle symbolises the rise and fall of the sun and shows that we are committed with our support to others. The pull up bar is a commonly availble equipment and symbolises being down-to-earth and beginner friendly. <br>
            The use of animal animal animation brings about a form of ambiguity and abstractness, allowing users to feel motivated. It allows users to keep attention and being easily viewable. The use of games allows users to play and use the website sites for longer periods of time to maximise algorithum intake.<br>
            Memes are stastiscally proven to be beneifical as said in https://www.gradedtalon.com/5153/features/why-memes-are-good-for-you/ <br>
            The h1 and h2 tags are aninmated to retain attention along with precise meta data as per learnt from courses conducted by google.

            SVG: There are a host of picture format availble, like png, jpg, webp and even database stored images. After bench and unit testing of the time it takes to load images, on average svg is the fastest loading picture format. Not only that, they allow for 0 picture detoriation, cross-platform manipulation, animation and modifiability.<br>
            Page formating: As little global css is used as possible. Global css still has its benefits but it might lead to data locks in server rendering. External stylesheets like bootstrap, tailwind,and the likes have a chance to be var locked and uncontrollable on my side. After extensive testing, css possition after js in the head section yield the fastest loding times.<br>
            Framework: Most of the framework is not meant to be the most condusive but for future purposes. Most of the programming languages that I use in this website is optimised for used for job purposes.<br>
            Service-Side Vs Local host: Although I have not used all of the frameworks, my wireframed is mostly optimised to work with one another creating the fastest loading time.

            Positioning: 1-D-> Just A dot, x-axis. 2-D-> The whole screen ,X+y axis. 3-D-> X + Y +Z axis. You can achieve this by changing the perspective. You can create a smaller object to be further and bigger object be closer. As such converting a 3d object in 2d plane involves the uses of proportional and relational change. This can be done with css ( relative positioning divs) and Javascript(dom manioulation like on scroll)<br>
            Shading: Another convincing way to produce a 3-D feel is rendering, this can be done through box shade and border radius divs. You create a "window" of light and imagine yourself as a light ray. Each time you "bounce" you create a brighter image. The polygonial fill of this results in rendering.<br>
            Camera: Now how do you show it? Imagine you are in the world, the best position is to start diagonally across all axis. Control access would make the 3d experience more enjoyable. 
            Shape: Now we all know how to make a cube with xyz axis, but what about a sphere? By shading in a radial way and creating contolls inversely proportional to the camera, it will look like a sphere.<br>
            Physics: Now add all the physics engine from stackoverflow.

            How do you do an animated font you might ask. You make the font bigger and change the background image of the font. You then take advantage of the repeat image attribute to make an endless flow. Continuously shift the image x axis.<br>
            How do you make it enter? Shift the y-axis on hover.

            This site use jquery, media query and percentage uses. By using blank instead of _black, it creates a better user experience.<br>
